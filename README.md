## AI-Based Crowd Monitoring Using YOLOv5 + DeepSORT
This repository contains the final AI implementation of our capstone project CrowdTrack:a real-time room occupancy and heatmap system using computer vision. 
The project was built with YOLOv5 for person detection, DeepSORT for tracking, and custom heatmap generation based on tracked movements.
